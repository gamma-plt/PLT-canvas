# PLT-canvas

Computer exploration of different PLT/Compiler concepts. 

### Compiler
1. [SimpleC Compiler](https://github.com/gamma-plt/canvas/tree/master/simpleCompiler)
A detailed implementation of a compiler, and an interpreter for a small subset of the C programming languages, as detailed in the link. The compiles compiles to a simple VM implemented there.
2. [Descensus](https://github.com/gamma-plt/canvas/tree/master/descensus)
A collection of hand written recursive descent parsers for some grammars. Simple grammars (textbook examples), grammars of toy programming languages, grammars for real programming languages, both acedemic ones and industrial ones (those categories are not exclusive).

### Functional Languages Implementation

### Software Verification

### Static Analysis

### Semantics

### Proof Assistants

/**
 * Token is a class to model a single token or lexical token
 * that represents the category (in case that the lexer succeeds)
 * of a program construct. The lexical analysis part, converts a
 * sequence of characters (the source code), into a sequence of
 * tokens, that is, strings with identified meaning. This class,
 * represents valued tokens, besides the category, a Token object
 * holds information on it's position within the source code, and
 * a value if needed. The information of every Token object is
 * encapsulated in this attributes:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>The line of the processed Token object
 * <li>The column of the processed Token object
 * <li>The type of the Token, that is, it's category
 * <li>The value of the Token, this is used only if needed, otherwise,
 * it should be null
 * </ul>

# Pascal Interpreter

This is an implementation of a very simple interpreter implemented in Java following the [@rspivak's tutorial](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/). The programming language that we're building the interpreter for is the magnificent [Pascal programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)), designed by Niklaus Wirth. It was one of the first languages to compile to an intermediate representation (bytecode). Here we are building an AST interpreter, not a compiler.
